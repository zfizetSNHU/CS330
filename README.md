    How do I approach designing software?
        What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
        What design process did you follow for your project work?
        How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

        When designing software, I like to take a holistic approach and think about the project from start to finish. I like to create either some sort of diagram or psuedocode to help guide my decisions once I'm actually coding the project.
        I'm not really artistic, but the design skills I have learned during this project have helped me gather some artistic knowledge when approaching 3D modeling projects.
        For my project, I didn't really have a set process. Like a painter, I just referenced my reference image when creating my 3D scene as I was working on it to help guide my decisions.
        The same idea could be utilized in the future by referencing design documents for projects I find myself working on.
        
    How do I approach developing programs?
        What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
        How did iteration factor into your development?
        How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

        I had never used a picture to help guide my development process before, so that was a first for me.
        Iteration factored quite a bit into my development, as I would create a new iteration of the project almost every single week, adding details like texture, lighting, etc.
        My approach to coding evolved throughout the milestones by adding bit by bit to my project, rather than spend several hours knocking out the entire codebase at once. 
        This allowed me to space out my work by adding little by little until I had a complete pictures.

        
    How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
        How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

        Computer Science will help me become the programmer/software developer I hope to be after graduation.
        Now that I know a bit about computational graphics, the science behind making graphics function can be applied to other projects I'll work on in the future in different classes. Knowing how and why things behave the way they do will help me make better decisions regarding design 
        and help me accomplish tasks more quickly in the future but reducing my need to troubleshoot in the future because I already know how something is supposed to behave given the code behind it.
        The same idea can be applied in a professional setting. It's like working on a car's engine. I could potentially fix issues a car engine was having through something like trial and error and by consulting resources. This would be very tedious and time consuming because
        assumedly, I have no idea how an engine is supposed to behave because I have never worked on an engine before. But, if I had gathered the knowledge behind engine behaviors and diagrams, etc., I would have a better understanding of what might be causing an issue that my car is having
        and how I could approach fixing it, because I know how the engine is supposed to function. The same logic applies here, I could work on a project with 0 previous knowledge or skill and could probably figure it out eventually. But now I have the knowledge and skill to know how something is upposed
        to work in OpenGL, so rather than it being a tedious process of trial and error, I now know how things behave and how to manipulate them to accomplish what I'm trying to do in my project work.
